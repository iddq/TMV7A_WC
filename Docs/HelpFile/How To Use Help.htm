  How To Use Help

	

The Help files contain a few features that you should know about.

There are hyperlinks throughout the text, in three colors:

  * Those in *purple* jump to a definition in the Abbreviations. You can
    also get to the Abbreviations by using the Contents tab;
  * The hyperlinks in *green* jump to various sections of the Helpfile
    that go into more detail about the subject of the link; and,
  * The hyperlinks in *blue* will attempt to link to a World Wide Web
    site to provide external resources that may help you with hardware
    and other issues. 

In all cases, once you have jumped to a new location, you can use the
Back button at the top of the Help screen to return to the previous
location in the Help files.

The '>>>' and '<<<' arrows allow you to move sequentially through all
topics.

You can use Help in two ways.

  * The Table of Contents can be found under the Contents tab at the top
    of the page. Use the Table of Contents to navigate to a topic; and,
  * The Index and Find tabs of the Help window will allow you to search
    for specific topics or individual words within the Helpfile.
